- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @heikkito
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automation, remote control and effective administration of IT-infrastructure wherever and whatever is needed
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Powershell, Python and in that order. DevOps duties are now in the backlog as my current duties are Sysadmin/IT-Manager

I have a few fully fleshed public scripts in the public section. Nothing fancy, just some of my more fleshed out scripts i use a lot.  

All my code items revolve around solving / easing day to day tasks around O365, AD and Azure.
