- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @heikkito. I live in Finland and have soon 30yrs of experience in IT. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automation, remote control and effective administration of IT-infrastructure wherever and whatever is needed. 'Automate everything' is truly here now to stay. In addition to this i have for the last 5 years had a persistent connection to DevOps in my day to day work. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Powershell, Shell-script, Python and in that order. DevOps related items are now on the backburner as my duties are now in the IT-Manager area managing things and speeding up processes myself with my own code contributions. 

I have a few fully fleshed public scripts in the public section. I use these scripts and their variant myself a lot so feel free to use them too if you have similar duties that need scripts. 

All my code items revolve around solving / easing day to day tasks around O365, AD and Azure.
