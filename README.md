- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @heikkito
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automation, remote control and effective administration of IT-infrastructure wherever and whatever is needed
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Powershell, Python and in that order. DevOps duties are now in the backlog as my current duties are Sysadmin/IT-Manager

I have no public source code here. At least not yet.  

All my code items revolve around solving and easing day to day tasks around O365, AD and Azure.  Powershell takes the lead but Python comes second as a more personal choice going forward.
