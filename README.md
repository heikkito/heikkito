- 👋 Hi, I’m @heikkito. I live in Finland and have some 30yrs of experience in IT. 

- 👀 I’m interested in automation, remote control and effective administration of IT-infrastructure wherever and whatever is needed. Lately focus is on AI and the benefits that bring to an organization

- 🌱 I’m currently not actively developing for free sourcing but i bring here source code i find useful. I do use Powershell to fix real world issues and some generic solutions that are complete i will upload here for public use in case someone has the same scenario

I have a few fully fleshed public scripts in the public section. I use these scripts and their variant myself a lot so feel free to use them too if you have similar duties that need scripts. 

All my code items revolve around solving / easing day to day tasks around O365, AD and Azure.
